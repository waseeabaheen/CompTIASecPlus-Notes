## Common Cryptographic Algorithms

### Symmetric Encryption
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):** Commonly used for encrypting bulk data.
- **ChaCha20:** A fast and secure stream cipher used in places like TLS.

### Asymmetric Encryption
- **RSA:** A widely used public-key cryptosystem.
- **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography):** Stronger and more efficient than RSA for smaller key sizes.

### Hashing Algorithms
- **SHA-256:** A secure hashing algorithm in the SHA-2 family; used for integrity checks and digital signatures.
- **HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code):** Used for message integrity and authentication using a hash function and a secret key.

### Key Exchange
- **Diffie-Hellman (DH):** A method for securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel.
- **ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral):** Diffie-Hellman using elliptic curve cryptography, offering stronger security with smaller key sizes.

## Key Security Concepts

- **CIA Triad:**  
  - **Confidentiality:** Ensuring that only authorized individuals or systems can access data.
  - **Integrity:** Protecting data from being altered or tampered with.
  - **Availability:** Ensuring data and services are accessible when needed.

- **AAA Model:**  
  - **Authentication:** Verifying the identity of users, systems, or devices.
  - **Authorization:** Determining what an authenticated entity is allowed to do.
  - **Accounting:** Tracking and logging the actions of users and systems.

- **Zero Trust:** Never trust, always verify. All traffic is treated as untrusted until verified, regardless of its origin.

- **Defense-in-Depth:** A strategy of applying multiple layers of security to protect systems and data, in case one layer is breached.

- **Non-repudiation:** Ensures that an action or transaction cannot be denied later on (e.g., digital signatures, logging).

- **Least Privilege:** Users and systems are granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job.

## Encryption and Authentication Protocols

- **SSL/TLS:** Secure Sockets Layer and its successor, Transport Layer Security, are protocols that provide encryption for communications over the internet (e.g., HTTPS).
- **IPsec:** Internet Protocol Security, a protocol suite for securing IP communications by authenticating and encrypting data packets.
- **S/MIME:** Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, used for encrypting email communications.

---

## Security Tools and Technologies

- **IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems):** Tools that monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and can take actions to block or alert administrators.
- **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):** A platform that provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by various hardware and software infrastructures.
- **NAC (Network Access Control):** Security solution that controls the access level of devices and users to a network based on policies.
- **WAF (Web Application Firewall):** A security tool that protects web applications from attacks by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic.

## Commands and Networking

### Linux Commands
- **`last`**: Show the last logins of users.
- **`journalctl -xe`**: View system logs with a focus on errors.
- **`ss -tulpn`**: Display open ports and associated processes.
- **`ps aux --sort=-%mem`**: View running processes sorted by memory usage.
- **`iptables`**: Command-line utility for setting up, maintaining, and inspecting the IP packet filter rules in the Linux kernel.

### Windows Commands
- **`Get-EventLog`**: Retrieve Windows event logs for audit purposes.
- **`netstat -ano`**: Display active network connections and listening ports, along with associated process IDs.
- **`Get-ScheduledTask`**: View scheduled tasks in Windows.
- **`net user`**: Display or modify user account details.
- **`Get-WinEvent`**: Get event logs with more detailed information than `Get-EventLog`.

## Security Operations

### Incident Response Phases
1. **Preparation:** Establish policies, tools, and teams for responding to incidents.
2. **Identification:** Detect an incident and identify its scope.
3. **Containment:** Isolate affected systems to prevent the incident from spreading.
4. **Eradication:** Remove the threat from the environment (e.g., deleting malware).
5. **Recovery:** Restore systems to normal operations.
6. **Lessons Learned:** Conduct a retrospective analysis to improve future incident response.

## Mini Labs & Practice Scenarios

1. **Password Cracking Demo**: Use `hashcat` or `John the Ripper` to crack a simple password hash using a wordlist.
2. **TLS Check**: Run `nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 site.com` to enumerate supported SSL/TLS ciphers on a web server.
3. **Network Segmentation**: Set up a simple VLAN or subnet and test traffic isolation using `ping` and `nmap`.
4. **DLP Setup**: Configure a basic data loss prevention policy on a file share or endpoint to block the transfer of sensitive files.
